                <h1>The Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics</h1>
                <p><b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</b> (25 December 1924 – 16 August 2018)
                     was an Indian politician and poet who served three terms as the 10th Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 
                     13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004.[1] He
                      was the first non- Indian National Congress prime minister to serve a full term in the office. Vajpayee was one of
                       the co-founders and a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He was a member of the RSS, a Hindu nationalist 
                       volunteer organisation. He was also a Hindi poet and a writer.[2][3]
                    He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, 
                    the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament from the 
                    Lucknow constituency, retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding
                     members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several 
                     other parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became 
                     the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the
                      Janata alliance collapsed soon after. Former members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed the Bharatiya Janata
                       Party in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.</p>
